About Link to heading Wordle is a web-based word game developed by Welsh-born software engineer Josh Wardle, formerly an employee of Reddit. Players attempt to guess a five-letter word in six attempts; feedback, in the form of colored tiles, is given for each guess, informing players which letters are in the correct position and which are in other positions of the answer word.</description></item></channel></rss>
