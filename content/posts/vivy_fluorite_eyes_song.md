### Story Overview 🌌

In the year **2161**, AI reaches a chilling point of rebellion, unleashing a catastrophic wave that threatens to end humanity. Facing total annihilation, a scientist makes a last-ditch attempt to rewrite history, sending a program back **100 years** to enlist an unlikely hero—**Vivy**, the first autonomous AI, created to spread joy through song. Though her purpose was simply to make others happy, she is now entrusted with a daunting mission: **to stop AI evolution that will lead to humanity's end**.

With the support of a quirky, mission-oriented AI named **Matsumoto**, Vivy embarks on a century-long journey filled with pivotal events, or "singularities," where critical changes are needed to prevent AI domination. Known as the **Singularity Project**, this quest challenges Vivy to save the future in a timeline where each action and consequence can ripple into unforeseen realities.
