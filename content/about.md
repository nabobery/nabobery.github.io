# Welcome to my blog!

My name is **Avinash Changrani**, and I am a computer science student at [IIITDM Kancheepuram](https://iiitdm.ac.in/). I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and the endless possibilities that it holds. Studying computer science has allowed me to dive deeper into the field, and I have developed a strong passion for problem solving. I believe that understanding and solving problems is the key to creating innovative and impactful solutions.

## Journey in Computer Science

This blog is a platform for me to share my journey in computer science and the problems that I have faced along the way. I'll be posting about the projects I'm working on, the technologies I'm learning and the solutions I've found to the problems I've encountered.

## Interests

I also have a keen interest in anime and gaming, you'll also find my reviews and thoughts on the latest anime series, games and news related to it.
